# Autonomous-Vehicle-Charging-System
With the rise of the age of EVs, there are certain problems that require our attention. One of them is devising a system that can automatically detect the vehicle's charging port and plug the socket into the charging port. The goal is to build an Autonomous Robotic Charging System for Autonomous Vehicles by using Image Processing, BIPS, and the Internet of Things.
For the task of autonomously detecting the port, we have devised a solution in which the decision-tree algorithm serves as the foundation of the software architecture. Through BLE Beacon of the car and the Bluetooth sensors, the approximate location of the socket is conveyed to the charging port and then the camera guides the manipulator further to the exact location via image processing.
